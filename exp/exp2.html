    /* This program is a Numbers Guessing game where the player picks a number between 1 and 10 through the browser's
     alert dialog and web page. The player has an infinite number of attempts to guess this number. If they choose the
     right answer, the browser will display a list showing their previous guesses. It will also display the
     right answer at the bottom, followed by a random treat the player earned by winning the game.*/
