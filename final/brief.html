            <h1>Project Brief: The road to Madlibs 2.0</h1>

            <h2>Project summary</h2>
            <p>I will be updating Project 2: Mad Libs by addressing the user experience and functionality shortcoming of the website.</p>
            
            <h2>Project Description</h2>
                <p>For our second project, we designed and developed a Mad Libs game from scratch using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Mad Libs is a classic word
                game that generates amusing stories based on user-provided words. I created Chicken Libs, a Mad Libs adventure centered on a fearless young 
                chicken exploring a field. While the project's development was relatively smooth thanks to ample class examples, time constraints prevented me 
                from implementing several enhancements.
                </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/button.jpg" alt="Active Button">
                <figcaption>Users should not be able to flip the card if there are empty fields.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p> One key functionality I plan to implement is preventing users from flipping to the next index card without completing all the fields. This was a common complaint from my peers, and I'm determined to address it.
            </p>
            
            <figure>
                <img src="images/help.jpg" alt="help button">
                <figcaption>Help is not very accessible and was invisible to most users during testing.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Additionally, I intend to enhance the game's usability by repositioning the Help feature, increasing the character limit from 9 to 12, and ensuring mobile compatibility. The Help feature's placement was criticized for being difficult to locate, and users struggled to come up with words under 9 characters.
            </p>

            <figure>
                <img src="images/mobile.jpg" alt="mobile">
                <figcaption>MadLibs is not optimized for mobile.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p> Mobile compatibility would be a significant improvement but also the most challenging to implement due to layout issues with the index card.
            </p>

            <h2>Expert feedback</h2>

            <p>
                My experience with Every Picture, our third project this semester, reinforced the importance of seeking expert feedback to elevate my website beyond peer review. To refine the code for new features, I intend to consult my older brother, a full-stack developer with over a decade of experience building professional websites and conducting usability testing. Additionally, I plan to seek guidance from my DES 116 professor and my UX designer roommate, both with extensive professional experience, to enhance the usability of my site. Their expertise will enable me to further refine my Mad Libs project, ensuring it is both visually appealing and accessible to a wide range of users.
