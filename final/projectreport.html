            <h1>Report: Finalizing MadLibs 2.0</h1>
            
            <p> For my final project, I collaborated with Kevin Duke for a code review of the Flip button feature in my
                Mad Libs assignment. To recap, I'm enhancing the Flip button's functionality. A frequent issue noted was the ability 
                of players to flip the index card without completing all input fields. This enhancement is more complex than it appears, 
                requiring checks to ensure all input fields are filled before flipping the card and preventing field checks on the card's 
                reverse side.
            </p>

            <p> Kevin Duke's expertise in code review and UI/UX suggestions is invaluable. With over five years in the frontend development 
                sector, creating professional websites from scratch, his skills in programming and usability studies are exceptional, surpassing
                many of his peers. Thus, his insights and review for the flip button coding are highly beneficial.
            </p>
            <h2>Discussion</h2>
            <p>
                Upon sharing my code with Kevin, he remarks that my javascript for the new flip button and input check logic is clean. There are not
                that many things that need to be refactored. But he suggested that I use let and const Instead of var. Modern JavaScript encourages 
                the use of let and const for variable declarations to avoid hoisting issues and to make the code more readable. 
            </p>

                <figcaption>I should be using let, not var, inside this check text event function.</figcaption>
            </figure>
          
            <p>
                Line 56 contains code that goes unused. I was experimenting with different button states, but I forgot to remove it. Removing it improves code 
                efficiency as it doesn't have to parse this state.
            </p>

                <figcaption>Line 56 has code that goes unused. Oops.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Kevin pointed out my event listener loop could be revamped for better performance. 
            </p>

                <figcaption>This section of code stops the browser from verifying input fields on the back side of the card.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>Instead of one listener per input, he recommended attaching a single listener to the parent element. This "event delegation" technique cuts code length and boosts flexibility, letting me add new fields with minimal fuss.
            </p>

                <figcaption>The same code using Event Delegation</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Overall, Kevin's advices and techniques made my improved MadLibs worthy of the "2.0" version. It's a whole lot cleaner and concise, making it more flexible for future features while making it less
                prone to bugs. I am thankful for his efforts and expertise to guide me through building a better Mad Libs.

                <figcaption>One additional improvement I made is making MadLibs work better for mobile.</figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                In addition to the button, I've also improved the page's accessibility. I made the website mobile compliant so that 
                people on the go can fill out Mad Libs with no trouble. I've also increased the font's size and made it easier for those
                to access the Help button.
