                <h1><a href="post1.html">Form and Function: Analyzing best practices for form design</a></h1>
                <p>We can find forms everywhere around the internet, be it before signing up for subscriptions, purchasing items, or social networking. They make a huge impact on how we operate on the web today—despite being labeled as the unavoidable evil for business. It's undeniable that they're a vehicle for information sharing today, and designers need to think of clever methods to avoid losing customers.</p>
                <p>In Salim Ansari's <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">article</a>, the author touches on effective strategies that designers can use to bolster customer retention and improve the user experience on forms. Keeping things simple is a great first step in reducing cognitive load—and a no-brainer choice that most designers seem to forget. Although removing fields takes more time, the reduced friction and higher completion rate is worth the tradeoff. This is something that I've noticed during the user research phase with my personal projects. In most cases, the users were more inclined to operate a system with minimalistic controls instead of one with high customization.</p> 
                <p>A strategy I learned from reading <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Ansari's writing</a> is the importance of asking the easy questions first. The author explains that users will feel less inclined to complete the forms if the website asks complex questions right from the start. I was unaware of this brilliant rapport-building strategy he talks about and look forward to incorporating this into my own design.</p> 
                <p>There's no shortage of bad web forms around the internet. Some feel clunky, too personal, or way too long for anyone to use the forms. But if designers incorporate some simple strategies like keeping forms simple, who knows: you might just double your conversion rate. </p>
